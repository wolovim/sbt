### Setup

A version of this contract is deployed on Sepolioa testnet at `0x49Cc1FC279BB61053f45a2aE586e9f9305153F29`,
but if you want to interact with the tests or iterate on the contract:

- clone this repo
- install ape: `pip install eth-ape`
- install plugins via config file: `ape plugins install .`
- compile contract: `ape compile`
- run tests: `ape test`
- deploy to sepolia: [import an account](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/accounts.html#importing-existing-accounts) then `ape run deploy`
